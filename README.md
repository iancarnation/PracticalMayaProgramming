# Practical Maya Programming with Python

These are Python scripts created while going through the [Practical Maya Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Python-Robert-Galanakis/dp/1849694729) book by [Rob Galanakis](https://www.robg3d.com/). Most of them are written verbatim from the book as they are built up during the chapters. The [case_studies](https://gitlab.com/iancarnation/PracticalMayaProgramming/tree/master/case_studies) section contains programs written on my own to practice what I'm learning.
